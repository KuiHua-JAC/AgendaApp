# AgendaApp
Project done in Fall 2022, after the third programming class.
WPF app used to schedule and plan tasks in a calendar. The user is presented with a large calendar UI, with the ability to add/view different tasks inside of it by clicking on the day on the calendar.

## Features (Pictures to come)

### Add tasks to a day in the calendar

### Delete tasks of a day in a calendar

### View the tasks of a day in the calendar
To see if they are completed and/or overdue

### View a list of overdue tasks

### View a monthly report of all the tasks, completed of not

### Import or export the tasks in a CSV

## How to run
For this app, since it was our first WPF app, we don't have an installer created for it, so in order to run it, you have to open the solution and run compile then run it using Visual Studio on Windows.

## Technologies used
Storing the data is done via CSV when the app is offline, otherwise everything is kept in memory.
C#, WPF were used for the project.
